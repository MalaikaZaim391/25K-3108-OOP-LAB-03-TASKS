## Task 02 – Mobile Phone Store

**Objective:**  
A mobile phone store wants to record phone details when new phones arrive. Each phone has a **brand name**, **model**, and **price**.

**Requirements:**  
- Create a `Mobile` class.  
- Use a **no-argument constructor** to assign default values.  
- Use a **parameterized constructor** to assign actual values.  
- Create objects using both constructors in the `main()` method.  
- Display phone information.

**Class:** `Mobile.java`  
**Key Features:**  
- `String brandName`, `String model`, `double price`  
- `display()` method to print phone details  
- Demonstrates default and parameterized constructors

## Task 03 – College Course Management

**Objective:**  
A college wants to manage course information. Each course has a **course code**, **course name**, and **credit hours**.

**Requirements:**  
- Create a `Course` class with appropriate data members.  
- Include a method to display course details.  
- Create at least **two course objects** in `main()` and call the display method.

**Class:** `Course.java`  
**Key Features:**  
- `String courseCode`, `String courseName`, `int creditHrs`  
- `display()` method to print course details  
- Demonstrates parameterized constructor usage

## Task 04 – University Computer Lab

**Objective:**  
A university computer lab wants to track computers installed in the lab. Each computer has a **system ID**, **processor type**, **RAM size**, and **operating system**.

**Requirements:**  
- Create a `Computer` class with appropriate data members and methods.  
- Create objects in `main()` to store information for different computers.  
- Display details for each computer.

**Class:** `Computer.java`  
**Key Features:**  
- `int systemId`, `String processorType`, `double ramSize`, `String operatingSystem`  
- `display()` method shows computer details  
- Demonstrates object creation and parameterized constructors

## Task 05 – Online Coding Platform Programmer Tracker

**Objective:**  
An online coding platform wants to store information about programmers using the platform. Each programmer has an **ID**, **name**, **preferred programming language**, and **number of problems solved**.

**Requirements:**  
- Create a `Programmer` class.  
- Include methods to **update problems solved** and **display programmer details**.  
- Create objects in `main()` and test functionality.

**Class:** `Programmer.java`  
**Key Features:**  
- `int id`, `String name`, `String prefProgLang`, `int problemsSolved`  
- `updateProblemsSolved()` method to modify solved problems count  
- `display()` method for printing programmer details  
- Demonstrates state change in objects
